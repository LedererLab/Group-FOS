# Group-FOS

This repository provides the  implementations of the methods described in [Balancing Statistical and Computational Precision and
Applications to Penalized Linear Regression with
Group Sparsity].


# Requirements
You need to install SPAMS toolbox.
 
# Usage
Files `NewFOS.m` and `GroupFOS.m` contain functions FOS and Group-FOS.  

# Simulations

We provide an example code in `script_simulation_unnormalized_GroupFOS.m` .

# Other files

`grplasso.m`: k-fold cross-validation group-lasso.

`simulate_linear_regression.m` generates data  and `simulate_linear_regression_group.m` generates structured data.

## Supported Languages and platforms

All of the codes in this repository are written in MATLAB and supports all plarforms which are
 supported by MATLAB itself.
